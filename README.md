This Power BI project focuses on analyzing nutrition data to improve performance and enhance decision-making within UNICEF Afghanistan’s nutrition section. It can serve as a one-stop-shop for using nutrition data produced by UNICEF support as well as other stakeholders. 

The initiative makes use of data from 12 different data sources, online platforms, and user submissions. It is built on a BI solution that allows data to be imported/refreshed regularly from source systems into a consolidated repository. SSIS and Python are commonly used to extract, transform, and load data.

The objective is to:
  * Identify trends and patterns in nutrition data to optimize resource planning and use.
  * Assess nutrition reach and program performance from the lowest level to the highest levels of granularity.
  * Enable managers at different levels to use the nutrition Dashboard and reports for day-to-day analysis and management of the nutrition program.
  * Provide features for comprehensive study of a single metric and triangulation of different indicators to determine the correlation and effect of one indicator over another.
  * Facilitate access to the underlying dataset for further investigation of the effectiveness of nutrition intervention programs in improving health outcomes of mothers and children.

The Power BI project employs a variety of visualizations, including line charts, bar graphs, geographic maps, Decomposition Tree, and other visuals to present data in a visually appealing and easily understandable manner.

By leveraging Power BI's analytics capabilities, our project has empowered decision-makers to make data-driven choices, resulting in improved performance, coordination, and strategic planning.

This PowerBI project leverages thousands of hospitals, pharmacies outs, and other private-sector health providers to help end users analyze and uncover investment opportunities.

The assessment was carried out in important hubs including as Kabul, Herat, Nangarhar, Kandahar, and Balkh provinces in 2018. The assessment data has been interpreted/quantified in this interactive dashboard with several filter options such as location, kind of health facility, specialization, human resource size, hospital bed size, and service availability. It also includes information about hospitals, pharmacies, imaging facilities, doctors, and laboratories in five major cities: Kabul, Herat, Nangarhar, Kandahar, and Balkh. The main component of the dashboard contains sub-dashboards for hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, imaging facilities, and independent doctors.

This is a practice project for visualizing a few supply chain KPIs. It focuses mainly on the following KPIs/metrics:

**Line Fill Rate:**
Assesses the efficiency of order fulfillment by measuring the percentage of order lines filled completely on the first shipment, reducing the need for follow-up shipments.

**Volume Fill Rate:**
Evaluates the percentage of ordered volume (units, weight, or value) shipped on the first attempt, indicating the efficiency of fulfilling large or bulk orders.

**On Time Delivery (OTD):**: 
Measures how reliably orders are delivered by the promised date, directly impacting customer satisfaction and service reliability.

**In Full Delivery (IFD):**
Evaluates whether orders are delivered with all items and quantities as requested, ensuring order completeness and accuracy. 

**On Time and In Full Delivery (OTIF):**
Combines OTD and IFD to assess the overall delivery performance, ensuring orders are both timely and complete, which aligns with customer expectations.

**Customer Order Cycle Time (COCT):**
Tracks the total time from order placement to delivery, providing insights into the efficiency of the order fulfillment process and affecting customer satisfaction.

**Delay in Delivery:**
Measures the time orders are delivered past the promised date, helping to identify and rectify delays in the supply chain that impact customer trust and satisfaction.

## [PBI Project 2: Life Expectancy](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/World-Life-Expectancy-between-1980-to-2019/m-p/3281695)

Following are some insights I was able to make from this dashboard:
* The average life expectancy has improved globally from 63 years in 1980 to 74 years in 2019.
* Europe had the highest average life expectancy of 74, while Africa had the lowest life expectancy of 55 years.
* In 1980, five countries ( Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Niger, South Sudan, Mali) had reported a life expectancy of under 40 years.
* No country had ever reported a life expectancy of 80 years or more in 1980, compared to 24% of countries in 2019.
